- Amazon and Guianas (Neotropical)
- Arctic Terrestrial (Nearctic)
- Borneo (Indo-Malayan)
- Congo Basin (Afrotropic)
- Coral Triangle (Marine)
- Madagascar (Afrotropic)

✅ **846 Total Species**:
- 234 hand-curated species with high-quality images
- 612 IUCN species from database backup
- 99.8% of species have images

✅ **Species Distribution by Ecoregion**:
- Amazon and Guianas: 176 species (40 curated, 136 IUCN)
- Arctic Terrestrial: 123 species (40 curated, 83 IUCN)
- Borneo: 129 species (36 curated, 93 IUCN)
- Congo Basin: 152 species (38 curated, 114 IUCN)
- Coral Triangle: 118 species (40 curated, 78 IUCN)
- Madagascar: 148 species (40 curated, 108 IUCN)

✅ **Conservation Status Tracking**:
- CR (Critically Endangered): 90 species
- EN (Endangered): 133 species
- VU (Vulnerable): 183 species
- NT (Near Threatened): 124 species
- LC (Least Concern): 310 species

✅ **Global Health Score**: 15.01/100
(Lower score reflects the critical conservation status of many species)

## 🚀 View Your App

Your dev server is running at:
- **Local**: http://localhost:8080/
- **Network**: http://192.168.1.199:8080/

The app should now display:
- All 6 ecoregion pins on the 3D globe
- Species data when you click each ecoregion
- Images for 99.8% of species
- Conservation status colors (red for CR, orange for EN, etc.)
- Species classification (Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Amphibians, etc.)

## 📂 Files Created During Restoration

### Scripts Used:
1. `update_ecoregion_names.py` - Updated ecoregion names to WWF convention
2. `clear_bad_species.py` - Cleared incorrectly imported data
3. `import_iucn_species.py` - Imported 612 IUCN species
4. `restore_species_from_csv.py` - Imported 234 curated species
5. `verify_database.py` - Verified all connections

### SQL Files:
1. `RESTORE_DATABASE_STEP_1.sql` - Database schema (already run)
2. `update_ecoregion_names.sql` - SQL for name updates

### Data Sources:
1. `database_species_with_images.csv` - 612 IUCN species backup
2. `curated_species_database_enriched.csv` - 234 hand-curated species

## 🔐 Security Reminder

**IMPORTANT**: Your .env file contains sensitive API keys. Make sure:

1. ✅ `.env` is in `.gitignore` (already done)
2. ✅ Old exposed OpenAI API key should be revoked at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
3. ✅ Service role key is ONLY in .env, never committed to Git
4. ✅ New OpenAI API key is safe in local .env file

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the app** - Click on each ecoregion to view species
2. **Check images** - Most species should have Wikimedia images
3. **Verify conservation colors** - CR=red, EN=orange, VU=yellow
4. **Test search** - Search for species names
5. **Check global health widget** - Should show 846 species tracked

## 📊 What Happened?

### The Problem:
- Original database had wrong ecoregion names
- Curated species were linked to incorrect ecoregions
- Missing IUCN species backup (shapefiles were HTML files, not actual data)

### The Solution:
1. Updated ecoregion names from database format to WWF format:
   - "Amazon Rainforest" → "Amazon and Guianas"
   - "Madagascar Forests" → "Madagascar"
   - "Borneo Rainforest" → "Borneo"

2. Cleared all incorrectly imported species

3. Imported 612 IUCN species from CSV backup with correct ecoregion links

4. Re-imported 234 curated species with correct ecoregion links

5. Verified all species-ecoregion connections

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If ecoregions don't appear:
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify Supabase connection (check Network tab)
3. Ensure dev server is running on port 8080

### If species are wrong:
1. Run `python3 verify_database.py` to check data
2. Ensure ecoregion names match WWF convention

### If images don't load:
1. Check image URLs in Supabase
2. Wikimedia URLs should work without API keys
3. Some species may legitimately lack images
