-- Diagnose why Borneo has 0 species linked
-- Check if IUCN species exist in Borneo region

-- 1. Check Borneo ecoregion details
SELECT name, center_lat, center_lng, radius_km
FROM ecoregions
WHERE name = 'Borneo';

-- 2. Count species with sample points near Borneo center
-- Borneo center: 0.9째N, 114.2째E, radius 1,216km
-- Check if ANY species have sample points in this general region (Borneo is roughly 0-7째N, 109-119째E)
