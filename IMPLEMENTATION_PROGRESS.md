## 📝 Notes & Decisions

### Design Decisions
- **UI Placement:**
  - User profile: Top-right corner (fixed)
  - Global health bar: Very top, full width (fixed)
  - Existing controls (map toggle, location, leaderboard): Top-center (unchanged)

- **Authentication:**
  - Using Google OAuth only (can add more providers later)
  - Allow guest mode (localStorage) for lesson viewing
  - Require auth for saving progress

- **Database:**
  - All in Supabase PostgreSQL
  - Using RLS (Row Level Security) for user data
  - Caching API responses to reduce redundant calls

### Open Questions
- [ ] What should global health % target be? (100% as community goal?)
- [ ] How often to recalculate global health? (real-time vs batch updates?)
- [ ] Should we allow re-taking lessons? (currently: yes, but no extra health points)

## 💡 Tips for Future Implementation

### When Resuming Work:
1. Check this file for current status
2. Look for "⏳ IN PROGRESS" tasks
3. Review dependencies before starting new tasks
4. Update status as you complete tasks
5. Commit frequently with descriptive messages

### Testing Strategy:
- Test each component in isolation first
- Use Supabase local development when possible
- Check browser console for errors
- Test on mobile viewport
- Verify API responses with console.log

### Performance Checklist:
- [ ] Lazy load components where possible
- [ ] Use React.memo for expensive components
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
- [ ] Cache API responses aggressively
- [ ] Use Supabase RPC functions for complex queries
