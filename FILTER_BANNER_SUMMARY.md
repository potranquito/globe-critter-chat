# Species Filter Banner Feature

## What was built

A **far-right vertical filter banner** that allows users to filter species displayed in the left-side species list by category.

## Key Features

### Visual Design
- **80px wide** vertical banner positioned on the far-right edge
- **Glass-panel styling** matching the app's existing dark theme aesthetic
- **Icon-only buttons** with helpful tooltips (hover to see descriptions)
- **Expandable Animals category** with sub-filters
- **Active filter indicators** (small dots on active filters)
- **Filter count badge** at the bottom showing total active filters

### Filter Categories
1. **🦁 Animals** (expandable)
   - 🦁 All Animals
   - 🦒 Mammals
   - 🦎 Reptiles
   - 🐸 Amphibians
   - 🐦 Birds
   - 🐟 Fish
   - 🦋 Insects
2. **🌿 Plants**
3. **⚠️ Endangered** (filters for CR/EN/VU conservation status)
4. **🌍 Ecosystems** (planned)
5. **🍽️ Food Chain** (planned)
6. **🌪️ Disasters** (planned)
7. **📰 News** (planned)
8. **🛡️ Protected Areas** (planned)

### Functionality
- Filters apply to both `HabitatSpeciesList` and `RegionSpeciesCarousel`
- Multiple filters can be active simultaneously (OR logic - shows species matching ANY filter)
- Filter count displayed in species list header: "X of Y species • N filters active"
- Empty state shown when no species match filters
- Filters reset when using the Reset button

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `src/types/speciesFilter.ts` - Type definitions for filter categories
- `src/components/SpeciesFilterBanner.tsx` - Main filter banner component
- `src/components/HabitatSpeciesList.tsx` - Created from scratch (was missing)

### Modified Files
- `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Added filter state and integrated banner
- `src/components/RegionSpeciesCarousel.tsx` - Added filter logic

## Layout Changes
- Right-side animal/habitat cards moved from `right-6` to `right-28` to make room for filter banner
- Filter banner appears only when species lists are visible (when `regionInfo` or `currentHabitat` exist)

## How to Rollback

If you want to undo this feature:
```bash
# Switch back to main branch
git checkout main

# Delete the feature branch (optional)
git branch -D feature/species-filter-banner
```

## Testing the Feature

1. Search for a location like "Las Vegas" or "Amazon Rainforest"
2. Look for the filter banner on the far-right side
3. Click the 🦁 Animals icon to expand animal sub-categories
4. Click 🦒 Mammals to filter only mammals in the species list
5. Notice the species count updates: "3 of 25 species • 1 filter active"
6. Try multiple filters - they work with OR logic
7. Use the Reset button to clear everything

## Future Enhancements
- Additional filter types (Ecosystems, Food Chain, etc.) are defined but not yet implemented
- Could add AND/OR logic toggle
- Could add "Clear all filters" button
- Could save filter preferences
